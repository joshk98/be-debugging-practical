# Backend Debugging Task
This material accompanies the **RESTful APIs** lecture.

This app was created with `@command-shift/create-backend-app`

## How to set up

Clone and run `npm install`

To run the tests run `npm t` or `npm test`

## Instructions

Debug tasks 1 - 7 have errors only in the app.js file, don't change any of the tests for these tasks.

Debug tasks 8 - 10 could have errors in the debugging.test.js file as well as the app.js file

Do not change code anywhere else. 

In the test file change ```xit``` to ```it``` to run a test. It is recommended to do this one test at a time otherwise there will be a lot of errors in the terminal. Once the test is passing you can move on to the next one.

The aim of this task is to see what error is being generated and to use this information to help correct the code.

If you do not understand an task, or get stuck, ask a mentor for help.
